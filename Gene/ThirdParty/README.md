### ThirdParty

This differs from dependencies in the root level `Dependencies` folder 
in the sense that the source files from these modules are built directly into 
Gene itself/compiled as a Gene engine source file and not seperatly into a independent 
lib. 

This is because these librarys are smaller and more lightweight. 
All attribution and licensing should be in the librarys folders.
